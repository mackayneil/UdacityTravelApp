# UdacityTravelApp

Udacity Travel App is the capstone project from the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course.
This project involved using 3 API's:

1 - Geonames to get the coordinates  of the users location input.

2 - WeatherBit to get the weather from the coordinates.

3 - Pixabay to load images of the user selected location.

The data from the API's are then displayed on the UI in the form of weather info for the location, images and number of days left until the trip.
